- Use: Digital Gold, Store of value
- First cryptocurrency
- Largest one
- Creator: Satoshi Nakamoto
- Created to allow “online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.”
- Introduced a digital decentralized ledger with miner (or validators) confirming the transactions.

### Ethereum (ETH)

- Use: Smart Contract Platform, Internet of Money
- Acts as an infrastructure for most decentralized applications. 
- Introduces smart contracts, which are like programs with specific procedures that, once deployed, no one can change.
- **Introduction of Ethereum Virtual Machine**
  - Before Ethereum, most of the blockchains were primarily related to the transactions of network-supported cryptocurrencies. Ethereum’s creator Vitalik Buterin thought of changing that concept and took a step forward in creating a more enhanced blockchain that will allow its users to customize data over the Ethereum network with the help of the “Ethereum Virtual Machine or EVM”. Now with EVM, users can conduct a transaction with the help of smart contracts.
- **Smart Contracts**
  - Thanks to Buterin, all transactions on the Ethereum blockchain are now secured with smart contracts. EVM ensures that all the terms and conditions of the transactions on Ethereum are agreed upon by both parties and are validated by a contract. Once agreed, these transactions are recorded on a public blockchain and are self-executed and there is no turning back. This is what makes these transactions smart and legitimizes the digital economy.
- **Decentralized Applications of DAPPS**
  - Smart contracts have revolutionized digital transactions. The list of transactions you can do on the Ethereum blockchain is limitless. From paying rent, donating money on charitable trusts, to sending emails, everything can be done on Ethereum and that too within minutes with the help of smart contracts. Apart from that, Ethereum allows users to build decentralized applications along with other services like financial derivates, token economy, reputation systems, voting systems, and file storage.
- **Ethereum Token Ether (ETH) and Ethereum Gas**
  - Ether or ETH is the native coin of the Ethereum blockchain and is used for all the transactions including the paying of rewards to its shareholders. The ETH token is also used to buy Ethereum Gas to run the blockchain. Every transaction and even smart contracts are fueled by the Ethereum Gas. The cost or amount of gas depends on the size of the transaction. The gas prevents the network to waste its resources and saves costs.
- Ethereum2.0
  - Sharding – It is a form of data partitioning where large databases are kept in small manageable resources.
  - eWASM – Ethereum Web Assembly (eWASM) helps in faster execution of the codes.
  - Plasma and Raiden – Scaling solutions that can handle large volumes of transactions. [Read About Raiden]
